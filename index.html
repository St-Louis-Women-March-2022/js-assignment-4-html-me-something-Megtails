         <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">At the end of 2019, I had been actively searching for a home. Come March 2020, the world had turned upside down and 
            I found myself instead quaranined with my 60-year-old mother. In a desparate need for some sort of comfort during such
            trying times, I turned to an old friend... anime. While I was a big fan during middle school, my mother had never actually
            watched any anime before. 
            <br><br>And thus began the journey of my mother experiencing anime for the first time.

               Despite only giving Skip Beat! an 8/10, she went on to read EVERY. SINGLE. VOLUME. of the manga

           This one made us both cry multiple times. The manga was a favorite of mine from childhood and I was delighted to see
            it finally get the full adaptation it deserves. Mom's favorite character is Hatsuharu, the character who turns into a cow
            (which happens to be her favorite animal).</p></div>

           "It's kind of naughty." I can't say I don't understand where she's coming from. We actually ended up watching this one twice: once in Japanese with 
           subtitles and once in English. She ended up enjoying it much more in English (the rating, however, reflects her initial impression). She even
            requests that I put on a random episode here and there when she wants a short something to lighten the mood.</p></div>

           This quickly became my mother's comfort anime, which I frankly did not see coming. She has requested we watch it about 5 times over
         the last two years (and I've indulged her at least 3 of those times). She is enamored with the art style and the beautiful animation.
         The heartfelt story is the cherry on top.</p></div>

           This charming anime is hard to dislike, even as an adult. However, I think her rating may have been skewed
         by the knowledge that this is my all-time favorite. It was very important to me during my formative years and
      remains one of the most influential pieces of media in my life.</p></div>

            <h4>Verdict</h4>
          <p>Rating: 9/10 <br><br>
           It is refreshing to have a male lead who is so secure in his affection for the leading lady in such a short amount of time. 
           Normally that gets dragged out forever. This is another one that we've come back to on a casual basis for when we need something short, sweet, and funny to watch
         as a palate cleanser.</p></div>

           The surreal humor took some getting used to for my mom, but she was swept up in their friendships and the

          <p>Rating: 10/10 <br><br>
           I had been unsure how my mother would feel about an anime that was such a departure from our usual fare. This is a far cry from our 
         romantic comedies and other lighthearted stories. But she was completely enthralled the entire time and eager for more. Despite sometimes
      mistakenly calling it "Murder Book" instead of Death Note, this is one of her favorites.</p></div>

           This was a rare instance where I had actually not seen the anime already before we started watching it together. It was
         a treat for the both of us. Though the romantic subplot is a tad unfulfilling, the comedy is top-tier.</p></div>

           This is the only anime that we are in the process of watching that is still being aired. Despite the dark premise, there
         is a surprising amount of heart to this story. I find that shonen written by women is a particular sweet-spot for me. It would seem
      this also rings true for my mother.</p></div>
